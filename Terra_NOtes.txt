after Installation of terraform in respective OS platforms

Always make new directory for different providers (AWS.AZURE.GCP) While using terraform init...cmd

>> terraform init 

This initilazies the directory for Terra core to check for config files and install necessary plugins.
Make sure to right the appropriate main.tf files for to start Init command.

>> terraform validate

This validates the config files for syntax and cross checks the plugin

>> terraform plan

 this shows the blueprint of all the necessary setups that would be completed.
 
>> terraform apply

this start installing the OS and other settings that is in the tf config file.

>>terraform destroy

this destroys the installed infrastructure and completly removes the defined infrastructure and 
also removes the all the data in terraform.tfstate file. 

the tfstate.backup file saves the previous data that was executed in the tfstate file.

*****Note***** the shortcomings of the terraform state file is only store the previous or the latest data from the 
provision that was executed.

************************************************************************

we can use:

>> terraform apply -auto-approve

to avoid pressing yes again during any prompts


# # #  to avoid using destroy command: # # # # # # # 


1. just delete the resource code from the config file just leaving the aws access key block code

and run > terraform apply command to remove the infrastructure that was build using the code and deleted

using the same block code, just be removing the resources in the config file.
